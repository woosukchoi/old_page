    Risk aversion is a fundamental element in labor market decisions, which inherently involve risks. This paper examines how risk aversion influences occupational choices and earnings inequality, using data from the NLSY97. Descriptive findings indicate that more risk-averse workers tend to have lower earnings, with the earnings gap widening as their careers advance. Moreover, the evidence shows that risk-averse individuals are more likely to choose occupations with higher earnings stability but limited opportunities for earnings growth. To explore the mechanisms behind the dynamic impact of risk aversion on earnings, I develop a structural model of occupational choice that incorporates human capital accumulation and heterogeneity in risk aversion. The model is estimated using the Conditional Choice Probability estimator accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. The estimated model confirms the considerable difference in the distribution of shocks to productivity across occupations, indicating the incentive for risk-averse workers to choose different occupations from the others. The decomposition of the earnings gap across risk attitude groups suggests that around 95 percent of the gap is due to risk-averse workers' choosing lower-profitability occupations. Moreover, differences in human capital accumulation across occupations explain about half of the gap, emphasizing the significance of self-selection on risk aversion and its compounding effect on earnings trajectories. Using the estimated model, I plan to demonstrate that social insurance with an earnings floor can improve welfare by promoting more efficient labor market allocations among risk-averse workers while also providing tangible support. Additionally, the counterfactual analysis will also discuss how assuming homogeneous risk aversion may lead to misguided conclusions about the welfare implications of social insurance.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In this paper we estimate major specific earnings profiles using matched American Community Survey (ACS) and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data. The advantage of the matched data relative to the ACS alone is that it provides a long panel of worker earnings, thus avoiding estimating life cycle profiles using cross- cohort variation. Once we allow the returns to major to vary by cohort, we find that engineering, computer science, and business majors experience faster earnings growth relative to humanities majors. For example, the gap in earnings between technical majors like engineering and computer science and humanities grows by 5-6% between ages 23 and 50. Our estimates also indicate that more recent graduates in these fields earn a larger premium relative to humanities than earlier cohorts.
