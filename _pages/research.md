  <summary>Abstract</summary>

  Risk preference is a fundamental element in labor market decisions, which inherently entail risks. This paper investigates the role of risk preference in occupation choices and earnings inequality, utilizing data from the NLSY97 and O*NET database. The descriptive findings suggest that workers with greater risk aversion tend to earn lower wages, and this wage gap becomes especially pronounced as their careers progress. Moreover, the evidence indicates that risk-averse individuals tend to choose routine occupations, which provide less opportunity for earnings growth. To investigate mechanisms driving the dynamic impact of risk preferences on earnings, I develop a structural model of occupation choice with human capital accumulation, allowing for heterogeneity in risk preferences. The model is estimated using the Conditional Choice Probability estimator accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. The estimated model underscores that the effect of differential human capital accumulation accounts for 40 percent of earnings inequality between risk attitude groups, highlighting the importance of considering the propagating effect of self-selection on risk attitudes. Using the estimated model, I show that routine-biased technological change contributes to larger disparities in occupation choices across workers with varied risk preferences, enlarging earnings disparities.
